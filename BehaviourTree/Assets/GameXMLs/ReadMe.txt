This folder will contain game xml files to see the dialogue with search lookup fields.

Supported files are items.xml, buffs.xml, quests.xml, and Localization.txt.

Note: Adding in the Localization file will take a fair amount of time to load.

These files will be read when a dialogue asset is opened. A force re-read can be done through the menu: 7 Days To Die -> Dialogue -> Reload Config
