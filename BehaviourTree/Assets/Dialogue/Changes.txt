v1.0.0.4

- Fixed a bug with the cvars not showing the set option for actions
- Fixed a bug in the requirements where the Hide requirement field was empty
- Added a new syntax to the Scratch feature
    - Statements are identified by starting at the start of the line ( no tab)
    - Statements can have reference key by placing a    === <key name>   above the statement
    - Responses are single tab-indented under neath their statements.
    - Response can link to another statement by using double tab, with a > character, followed by a key name.

No support for setting actions or requirements. Once the conversation is added, you can go through the node editor to 
add the requirements and actions.

Sample:

=== start
Hi... 
	Are you an actual nurse?  
		> start_01
	[ Tell Your Story ]
		> YourStory
	[ Give Gift ]
		> GiveGift
	[ Hire ] 
		> HireThem
		
=== HireThem
I'd like to hire you.
	No
		> start
=== start_01
You think I wear this outfit for the fun of it? Yes, I'm a real nurse. I was at work when the world went to shit. 
I worked with a group of first responders. We got a call to the skate park because there was some kids getting sick. We got there, and it was a shit show. All the kids there were sick, and throwing up.
	What made them sick?

v1.0.0.3

- Fixed a bug where quest_entry wasn't being saved during import
- Added Import Node 
    - The Import Node takes a reference to another Dialog graph.
    - You link the Import Node to the Statement you want to merge with
    - The "start" node of the Imported Dialog will be removed.
    - The connected Statement will keep track of the attached Dialog and merge the results during export.
    - Multiple Imports can be connected to the same Statement
    - Imports can be attached to any Statements.
    - Since the merging only happens on an Export, the Imported Dialog will continue to be updated as you change it.
    - If you want to isolate the target dialog, make a copy of it first.
- Added Quest Template Dialog
    - This only contains the elements required to add the quest dialogs to an NPC
    - Note: You still need to make a reference on your npc.xml to reference a valid quest line.
- Added Seller Template Dialog
    - This only contains the basic functionality to allow the NPC to buy and sell goods.    
    - Note: You still need to make a reference on your npc.xml to reference a trader inventory. 
- Fixed the Dialog Test Runner to reference Import Nodes
- Fixed a few bugs with the Export manager involving statements from Import Nodes

- Included vanilla's items.xml, buffs.xml, quests.xml, and modified localization.

v1.0.0.1
- Fixed an issue with Localization not being read from the GameXMls folder, and Imports folder
- Added version number to the UI
- Adjusted folders so a new version of the Dialogue can be added without removing old imports / dialogs
- Code clean up.
- Added documentation.


- Added Scratch, aka Quick Doodle.
    - Allows parsing of plain text to auto-generate connected Statements and Responses.
        - Responses don't link up with their next statements yet.

        - Responses are linked to the last Statement read
        
    Format:
        Statement
            Response #1
            Response #2 
 
- Fixed a padding issue around the Action/Requirement text fields that caused a misalignment.

    - ie: bufftest01 instead of buffOrderFollow from the import example.

- Added character limit on the Nodes menu.
- Fixed an issue where Requirement and Actions did not have a unique GUID, causing them to display incorrectly when more than one was on a single node.
