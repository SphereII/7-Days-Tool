v1.0.0.3

- Fixed a bug where quest_entry wasn't being saved during import
- Added Import Node 
    - The Import Node takes a reference to another Dialog graph.
    - You link the Import Node to the Statement you want to merge with
    - The "start" node of the Imported Dialog will be removed.
    - The connected Statement will keep track of the attached Dialog and merge the results during export.
    - Multiple Imports can be connected to the same Statement
    - Imports can be attached to any Statements.
    - Since the merging only happens on an Export, the Imported Dialog will continue to be updated as you change it.
    - If you want to isolate the target dialog, make a copy of it first.
- Added Quest Template Dialog
    - This only contains the elements required to add the quest dialogs to an NPC
    - Note: You still need to make a reference on your npc.xml to reference a valid quest line.
- Added Seller Template Dialog
    - This only contains the basic functionality to allow the NPC to buy and sell goods.    
    - Note: You still need to make a reference on your npc.xml to reference a trader inventory. 
- Fixed the Dialog Test Runner to reference Import Nodes
- Fixed a few bugs with the Export manager involving statements from Import Nodes



v1.0.0.2
- Included vanilla's items.xml, buffs.xml, quests.xml, and modified localization.

v1.0.0.1

- Added version number to the UI
- Adjusted folders so a new version of the Dialogue can be added without removing old imports / dialogs

- Added Scratch, aka Quick Doodle.
    - Allows parsing of plain text to auto-generate connected Statements and Responses.
        - Responses don't link up with their next statements yet.

        - Responses are linked to the last Statement read
        
    Format:
        Statement
            Response #1
            Response #2 
 
- Fixed a padding issue around the Action/Requirement text fields that caused a misalignment.

    - ie: bufftest01 instead of buffOrderFollow from the import example.
