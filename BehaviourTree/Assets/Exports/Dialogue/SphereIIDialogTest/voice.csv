"Hi..." 
"I'd like to hire you." 
"You think I wear this outfit for the fun of it? Yes, I'm a real nurse. I was at work when the world went to shit." 
"I worked with a group of first responders. We got a call to the skate park because there was some kids getting sick. We got there, and it was a shit show. All the kids there were sick, and throwing up." 
"We didn't know at first. We thought it might have been a gas leak, so we called in support from the bio-lab. They came in their hazmat suits, but by the time they arrived, it was too late." 
"The lab workers didn't detect any gas leak, so they cleared the area for us to go get the bodies. That's when things got really bad." 
"The kids started to get up, growling and snarling at us. I ran back to the van, but I was the only one who made it..." 
"I hid in the van for hours, hearing them snarl and growl. I must have fallen asleep; when I woke up, it was all quiet. I woke up to this new hell." 
"Sorry doesn't make it go away. But thanks for listening." 
"You must have gotten hit in the head pretty hard, if you don't remember a lot. Sounds like a touch of amnesia." 
"Amnesia is the fancy word for losing your memory. It can happen if you get hit in the head, if you've gotten a fever, or a few other causes." 
"It's hard to say. I'm not a doctor, so it's not really area. It might get better over time. You'll just have to have some patience." 
"What the hell? I don't give a shit about you believe. I'm done with you." 
"I can understand that. We are all stressed. You don't see us taking it out on others though." 
"Poison people?! What the hell is your problem?"
