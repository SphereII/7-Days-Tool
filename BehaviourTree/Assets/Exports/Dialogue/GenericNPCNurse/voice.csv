"cyberpunk2077","cp_dakota","Hello, traveler! How may I assist you amidst these troubled times?" 
"cyberpunk2077","cp_dakota","Before everything turned upside down, I was a nurse in Phoenix. I've been using my medical knowledge to help survivors ever since. We're all in this together, after all." 
"cyberpunk2077","cp_dakota","There's an abandoned pharmacy in the next town. You might find some medicine there, but tread carefully, the place is crawling with the undead." 
"cyberpunk2077","cp_dakota","There's a well in the center of this town. The water's still potable, but always remember to boil it first." 
"cyberpunk2077","cp_dakota","The nearest safe zone is the old trading post. It's about half a day's walk from here. The folks there have fortified the place and they're always looking out for fellow survivors." 
"cyberpunk2077","cp_dakota","Hello friend, how can I help you?"
