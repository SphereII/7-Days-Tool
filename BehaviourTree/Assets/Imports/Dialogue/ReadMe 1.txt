This folder will contain base dialogs.xml, and allow dialogue tool to read, and convert into the graph view.

Once you have a file here, click on "7 Days To Die" => Dialogue => Import

Files will appear under Assets\Dialogue\Imported, using the dialogId as a file name.

If the file exists, it will not re-import, so if you want to do a fresh import, delete the asset file from the Imported folder first.
